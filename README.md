1.Creating A sample demo dag


Define a DAG with tasks and dependencies using Python code.

Specify tasks, dependencies, and scheduling intervals in the Airflow UI.
Example code provided.

Tasks could include simple operations like printing messages or executing scripts.

Demonstrate the DAG execution flow in the Airflow UI.

2. Explore BashOperator


Use BashOperator to execute bash commands.

Create tasks to perform specific actions in the DAG.

Provide examples of bash commands to execute.

Ensure proper handling of bash command outputs and errors.

Validate the execution of bash tasks in Airflow UI logs.

4. Explore PythonOperator


Use PythonOperator to execute Python functions.

Create tasks to perform specific actions in the DAG.

Define Python functions to execute within the operator.

Ensure proper exception handling and logging within Python functions.

Verify Python task execution results in Airflow UI logs.

5. Explore TriggerDagRunOperator



Use TriggerDagRunOperator to trigger another DAG.

Create tasks to perform specific actions in the DAG.

Specify the DAG to trigger and any required parameters.

Verify the triggering of the specified DAG upon task execution.

Check the status and logs of the triggered DAG in Airflow UI.

6. Define Dependencies Between Tasks



Set up upstream and downstream dependencies between tasks.

Define task retries and rescheduling as needed.

Use >> operator or set_upstream and set_downstream methods to define dependencies.

Configure retry behavior and rescheduling options in DAG definition.

Verify dependency resolution and task retries in Airflow UI.

7. Use Sensors


Implement sensors to wait for certain conditions before task execution.

Experiment with sensors like FileSensor, HttpSensor, and TimeSensor.

Configure sensors to check for file existence, HTTP responses, or time conditions.

Set appropriate poke intervals for sensors to check conditions.

Observe sensor behavior and task triggering based on sensor conditions in Airflow UI.

8. Experiment with Scheduling Options
Utilize cron expressions or interval-based schedulin

Schedule DAGs to run at specific times or recurring intervals.

Define scheduling intervals using cron syntax or timedelta objects.

Configure DAGs to run hourly, daily, weekly, or custom intervals.

Monitor DAG execution scheduling and timing in Airflow UI.
